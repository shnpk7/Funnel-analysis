-- DATA CLEANING
-- *************

-- 1. Create events_cleaned with Parsed Columns
CREATE TABLE events_cleaned AS
SELECT 
  *,  -- keep all original columns
  -- Parse amount
  (REPLACE(value, '''', '"')::json->>'amount')::double precision AS transaction_amount,
  -- Parse offer_id with fallback for both key styles
  COALESCE(
    REPLACE(value, '''', '"')::json->>'offer_id',
    REPLACE(value, '''', '"')::json->>'offer id'
  ) AS offer_id,
  -- Parse reward
  (REPLACE(value, '''', '"')::json->>'reward')::double precision AS reward_amount
FROM events;




-- *************************
-- EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
-- *************************

-- 1. Identify events for funnel analysis
SELECT 
	DISTINCT(event)
FROM events_cleaned

/* Identified events used in the funnel: offer received, offer viewed, transactions, offer completed.
Will be removing 'transactions' from the funnel analysis as this is synonymous as 'offer completed' for the reward flow. */


-- 2. Basic funnel count
SELECT event, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS event_count
FROM events_cleaned
WHERE event IN ('offer received', 'offer viewed', 'offer completed')
GROUP BY event
ORDER BY 2 DESC


-- 3. Calculate dropoff rate
WITH funnel_data AS (
    SELECT event, COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS event_count
	FROM events_cleaned
	WHERE event IN ('offer received','offer viewed','offer completed')
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT 
    event, 
    event_count,
    LAG(event_count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY event_count DESC) AS previous_count,
    (LAG(event_count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY event_count DESC) - event_count) * 100.0 / LAG(event_count, 1) OVER (ORDER BY event_count DESC) AS churn_rate
FROM funnel_data
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

/* The biggest dropoff happens between offer viewed and offer completed (24%). Investigate why and how to optimize this part. */


-- 4. Calculate dropoff rate by offer type
WITH funnel_data AS (
  SELECT 
    o.offer_type,
    e.event,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.customer_id) AS event_count
  FROM events_cleaned e
  LEFT JOIN offers o ON e.offer_id = o.offer_id
  WHERE e.event IN ('offer received', 'offer viewed', 'offer completed')
  GROUP BY o.offer_type, e.event
),
ranked_funnel AS (
  SELECT 
    offer_type,
    event,
    event_count,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY offer_type ORDER BY event_count DESC) AS step_order,
    LAG(event_count) OVER (PARTITION BY offer_type ORDER BY event_count DESC) AS previous_count
  FROM funnel_data
)
SELECT 
  offer_type,
  event,
  event_count,
  previous_count,
  ROUND(
    CASE 
      WHEN previous_count IS NULL THEN NULL
      ELSE (previous_count - event_count) * 100.0 / previous_count
    END, 2
  ) AS dropoff_rate
FROM ranked_funnel
ORDER BY offer_type, step_order;
